# AnnotateWithDjango

Development of an annotation tool using JAVASCRIPT and DJANGO

To draw my objects I use : 
- Canvas
- Fabric : Fabric.js is an HTML5 JavaScript canvas library
          =>  It facilitates graphic creation in an HTML <canvas> element

To run the program : python manage.py runserver
